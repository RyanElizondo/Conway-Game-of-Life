CS112 (Data Structures) Assignment where we were tasked to create Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, specifically, 10 methods that were integral to the functionality of the game and required advanced knowledge of loops, Array Lists, and the weighted quick union find algorithm to successfully complete it and pass a total of 212 test cases.
